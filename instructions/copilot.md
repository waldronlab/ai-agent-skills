# GitHub Copilot

## Simple IDE-independent approach

The simplest portable approach is to give Copilot a short bootstrap prompt such as:

```text
Use the waldronlab AI agent skills from this repository: /path/to/ai-agent-skills.
Start with SKILLS.md to find the best matching skill.
Then read the corresponding skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md file and follow it.
If more than one skill matches, list the options briefly and choose the best fit.
```

This is not the same as installed persistent skills, but it is the simplest natural-language pattern that can work across Copilot surfaces and IDEs.

## Persistent setup for Copilot Agent in VS Code

Open VS Code, then add the waldronlab skills you want to use to Copilot's skill locations.

1. Clone the repository if needed:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waldronlab/ai-agent-skills.git
   ```

2. Open VS Code user `settings.json` and add the skill directories you want from [SKILLS.md](../SKILLS.md):
   ```json
   {
     "chat.skillsLocations": [
       "/path/to/ai-agent-skills/skills/create-skill",
       "/path/to/ai-agent-skills/skills/check-waldronlab-skills",
       "/path/to/ai-agent-skills/skills/analyze-r-package"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. Reload VS Code.

## Usage

To confirm the setup worked, ask:

```text
What waldronlab skills do I have?
```

To use the skills, ask naturally. For example:

```text
Help me create a new skill
Analyze this R package
Create .github/instructions for this package
```
