# Available Skills

This is the canonical index of all available AI agent skills in the waldronlab/ai-agent-skills repository. Use this to discover and understand what skills are available and when to use them.

## Quick Start

1. **Browse by category** below to find a skill that matches your need
2. **Read the skill description** to understand when to use it
3. **Invoke naturally**: Describe what you need to your AI agent
   - Example: "Help me create a new skill"
   - Agent will match this to the appropriate skill and invoke it

**Platform shortcuts**: Optional shortcuts (like `/skill-name` or `@workspace` patterns) are documented in [instructions/](instructions/) for each platform.

## Setup & Discovery

**First time?**
- See [instructions/claude.md](instructions/claude.md) (Claude Code)
- See [instructions/copilot.md](instructions/copilot.md) (GitHub Copilot)

**Understanding the design:**
- See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for how skill discovery and invocation work
